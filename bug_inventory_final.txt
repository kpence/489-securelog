FileReaderWriter.cc | 122 | infer | error: DEAD_STORE.
FileReaderWriter.cc | 678 | infer | error: NULL_DEREFERENCE.
logappend.cc | 61 | flawfinder | (buffer) strcpy: Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).
logappend.cc | 91 | flawfinder | (buffer) getopt: Some older implementations do not protect against internal buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20). Check implementation on installation, or limit the size of all string inputs.
logread.cc | 27 | flawfinder | (buffer) getopt: Some older implementations do not protect against internal buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20). Check implementation on installation, or limit the size of all string inputs.
EntryParser.cc | 212 | flawfinder | (buffer) char: Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the maximum possible length.
FileReaderWriter.cc | 173 | flawfinder | (buffer) char: Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the maximum possible length.

FileReaderWriter.cc | 179 | flawfinder | (buffer) char: Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the maximum possible length.
FileReaderWriter.cc | 215 | flawfinder | (buffer) memcpy: Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120). Make sure destination can always hold the source data.
FileReaderWriter.cc | 216 | flawfinder | (buffer) memcpy: Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120). Make sure destination can always hold the source data.
FileReaderWriter.cc | 217 | flawfinder | (buffer) memcpy: Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120). Make sure destination can always hold the source data.
FileReaderWriter.cc | 233 | flawfinder | (misc) open: Check when opening files - can an attacker redirect it (via symlinks), force the opening of special file type (e.g., device files), move things around to create a race condition, control its ancestors, or change its contents? (CWE-362).
FileReaderWriter.cc | 389 | flawfinder | (buffer) char: Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the maximum possible length.

FileReaderWriter.cc | 452 | flawfinder | (buffer) char: Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the maximum possible length.
FileReaderWriter.cc | 466 | flawfinder | (buffer) char: Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the maximum possible length.
FileReaderWriter.cc | 467 | flawfinder | (buffer) char: Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the maximum possible length.
FileReaderWriter.cc | 470 | flawfinder | (buffer) memcpy: Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120). Make sure destination can always hold the source data.
FileReaderWriter.cc | 393 | flawfinder | (buffer) read: Check buffer boundaries if used in a loop including recursive loops (CWE-120, CWE-20).
FileReaderWriter.cc | 632 | flawfinder | (buffer) strlen: Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).
FileReaderWriter.cc | 685 | flawfinder | (buffer) strlen: Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).
